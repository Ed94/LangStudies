## Lectures

Contains notes taken from the lecture vods.

## Scripts

Contains some implementation from the lectures but I have no completed it yet...

I made my own context-free version of the language callled "SRegEx"  
This is mainly what I wanted at the end of the day...

Currently the script only translates to RegEx,  
I still need to make RegEx to SRegEx
